 * Falcon Error codes:
 *    FALCON_ERR_SUCCESS  ( 0) : Call is successful
 *    FALCON_ERR_RANDOM   (-1) : Library tries to use an OS-provided RNG, but either none is supported, or that RNG fails.
 *    FALCON_ERR_SIZE     (-2) : A buffer has been provided to the library but is too small to receive the intended value.
 *    FALCON_ERR_FORMAT   (-3) : Decoding of an external object (public key, private key, signature) fails.
 *    FALCON_ERR_BADSIG   (-4) : Error verifying a signature. The signature is validly encoded, but its value does not match the provided message and public key.
 *    FALCON_ERR_BADARG   (-5) : A provided parameter is not in a valid range.
 *    FALCON_ERR_INTERNAL (-6) : Some internal computation failed.
 * In the interest of forward compatibility, callers should be prepared to receive additional error codes not included in the list below.
